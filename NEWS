New Features and Important Changes, r0.3 vs r0.2

Author(s) :  Alexey PETROV

* Adjusting to the "common configuration system" (confFoam package)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
"confFoam" is a "common configuration package" for the realted OpenFOAM (Open
Source CFD Toolbox, see http://sourceforge.net/projects/foam/ ) developement. 
The neccessity for defintion of such kind of functionality appears from the
issue that OpenFOAM referece build system does not provide corresponding
capabilities. As result of lack of the configuration capabilties OpenFOAM
users/developers strugle with compilation procidure trying to discover reasons
for this or that failure.

* Providing of initial version of project documentation
-------------------------------------------------------
Corresponding AUTHORS, COPYING, LICENCE, README, INSTALL, NEWS and ChangeLog
files were prepared and added to the project sources.
